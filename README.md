# My Bash Scripts
These are my scripts that I have created to assist my work while using linux.

## How to Download my scripts

On the command line you need to type in this command to clone my scripts to your computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeveloperSavage14/bash_scripts.git
``` 
### Scripts in detail

#### Git Setup (git_setup.sh)

My Git Setup script is a small script that I have written, I made this
because I wanted a way to create a git repository without having to type out each command 
every time and refer back to my memory.

##### How To Use Git Setup

To use git setup you need to run this command.
```
bash git_setup.sh
```
Once the command has been run you should be prompted for an input.
Here you should input the name of your repository on git
then it will run and add a README.md file with the heading being your repo name.
